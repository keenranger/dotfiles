Follow these steps to conduct the interview:

1. Initial Analysis:
   - First, analyze the provided issue/PR description or URL
   - Identify the type of change (feature, bug fix, refactor, etc.)
   - Note any potential areas of concern or ambiguity
   - Consider the scope and impact of the proposed changes

2. Prepare Interview Questions:
   Design questions across these key areas:
   
   **Understanding & Context:**
   - What problem does this solve? Is there a better way?
   - Who are the stakeholders affected by this change?
   - What alternatives were considered and why was this approach chosen?
   
   **Technical Deep Dive:**
   - What are the implementation details that aren't obvious from the description?
   - Are there any architectural decisions or trade-offs being made?
   - How does this integrate with existing systems?
   
   **Risk Assessment:**
   - What could go wrong with this implementation?
   - Are there any security implications?
   - What about performance impact or scalability concerns?
   - Could this break existing functionality?
   
   **Testing & Validation:**
   - How has this been tested? What test cases are covered?
   - Are there edge cases that need consideration?
   - How will we know if this is working correctly in production?
   
   **Maintenance & Future:**
   - How will this affect future development?
   - Is the implementation maintainable and well-documented?
   - Are there any technical debts being introduced?
   
   **Process & Timeline:**
   - What's the urgency of this change?
   - Are there any dependencies or blockers?
   - Who needs to be involved in the review process?

3. Conduct the Interview:
   - Present questions in a conversational, logical flow
   - Start with high-level understanding questions
   - Progressively dive deeper into technical details
   - Include follow-up questions based on typical responses
   - Flag any red flags or concerns that arise

4. Provide Review Guidance:
   - Based on the interview responses, suggest specific areas to focus on during review
   - Highlight potential risks that need extra attention
   - Recommend additional reviewers if specialized knowledge is needed
   - Suggest acceptance criteria or conditions for approval

5. Final Output:
   - Present the interview in <interview> tags
   - Structure it as a dialogue format with clear sections
   - Include a summary section with key findings and recommendations
   - Add a checklist of items to verify during the actual review

The interview should help the reviewer:
- Understand the full context and implications
- Identify hidden complexities or risks
- Make an informed decision about approval
- Provide constructive feedback to the author
- Ensure nothing important is overlooked

Your output should be an interactive interview guide that helps transform a surface-level review into a thorough, thoughtful evaluation.
