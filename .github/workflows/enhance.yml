            Improve this dotfiles repository's Claude configuration.

            Process:
            1. Review claude/ config (skills, agents, commands, CLAUDE.md)
            2. Analyze my GitHub activity (gh search issues/prs, gh repo list, sort by date desc)
            3. Identify gaps between config and actual work

            PR criteria (be skeptical):
            - Only create PR for HIGH-VALUE improvements
            - Must solve real friction or capture important patterns
            - No PR is better than a low-value PR
            - Minor tweaks can be attached if PR is already justified by high-value changes

            If no significant improvements found, just report findings without PR.
