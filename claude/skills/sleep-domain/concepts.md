## Hypnogram

Time-series representation of sleep stages throughout the night.
- X-axis: time
- Y-axis: sleep stage
- Typical visualization: Wake at top, Deep at bottom

## Key Metrics

| Metric | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Total Sleep Time (TST) | Actual time asleep |
| Sleep Efficiency | TST / Time in Bed |
| Sleep Latency | Time to fall asleep |
| WASO | Wake After Sleep Onset |
| REM % | Portion of sleep in REM |
| Deep % | Portion of sleep in deep |

## Sleep Quality Factors

- Sleep stage distribution (REM, Deep, Light balance)
- Number of awakenings
- Sleep continuity
- Consistency with circadian rhythm
