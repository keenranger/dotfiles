# Pattern Discovery

How to find patterns in work that should become skills or agents.

## Sources

### GitHub Activity
- Repos: What projects are active?
- PRs: What changes are made repeatedly?
- Issues: What problems recur?
- Commits: What patterns in commit messages?

### Conversation History
- What context is re-established often?
- What questions are asked repeatedly?
- What corrections are made?

### Current Configuration
- What skills exist?
- What agents are defined?
- What commands are available?
- What's in CLAUDE.md?

## Pattern Types

### Domain Patterns
Knowledge about a specific field:
- Terminology
- Common pitfalls
- Best practices
- Edge cases

### Workflow Patterns
How work gets done:
- Steps in a process
- Decision points
- Tools used
- Output formats

### Preference Patterns
Personal style:
- Code style
- Communication style
- Tool preferences
- Quality standards

## Signals

### "I wish Claude knew..."
Direct signal of knowledge gap.

### Repeated Explanations
Same context given multiple times = should be a skill.

### Corrections
"No, I meant..." = preference not captured.

### Friction
Tasks that feel harder than they should = missing knowledge or tooling.
