Quickly review and summarize: $ARGUMENTS

Answer: What is being changed? Why? How does it impact the codebase? Who is affected? When should this be prioritized?

Provide:
- Quick summary (2-3 sentences capturing essence)
- Key changes (max 5 bullets, focus on what matters)
- Impact analysis (scope, risk level, dependencies)
- Critical questions (3-5 questions about unclear requirements, edge cases, technical debt, testing)
- Bottom line (one paragraph: ready to proceed? main concerns? recommended next step?)

Goal: Rapid understanding, not deep analysis. Be direct and practical.
